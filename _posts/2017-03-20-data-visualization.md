As a developer, when most people hear about Data Visualizations, the first thing that comes to their mind is use a library and write some code to create bar charts, graphs, line charts,etc. But as I dived deeper into the topic I realized there is more to it than just writing code.

Data Visualization is an art. It is presentation of data in such a way that it enables people to make decisions based on the visual analysis. It allows people to grasp difficult concepts and identify new patterns. These are some of the key points which I keep in mind to create effective Data Visualizations.

Don't use redundant coding

Redundant coding

Pre attentive Attributes
The use of colors

Keep high data to ink ratio

Data to ink ratio is the ratio of ink used to depict data upon the total ink used. Keeping this high would ensure that most of the ink is used in depicting data and the extra "non-data" ink could be removed. This would allow user to focus on the data completely and thus would help people in understanding the visualization more easily.

Some of the best ways to achieve this are -
removing the background
removing the 3-D effects

don't use different color if the data is not color coded.

Keep a check on the Lie Factor
